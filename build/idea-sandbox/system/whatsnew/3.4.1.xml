           The new Project Structure Dialog (PSD) makes it easier to keep dependencies updated
           and configure different aspects of your project, such as modules, build variants and
           variables, and signing configurations. Open the PSD by selecting
           <b>File &gt; Project Structure</b> from the menu bar.

           <br><br>
           R8 integrates desugaring, shrinking, obfuscating, optimizing, and dexing all in one
           step—resulting in noticeable build performance improvements. R8 was introduced in Android
           Gradle plugin 3.3.0 and is now enabled by default for both app and Android library
           projects using plugin 3.4.0 and higher.

           This pane also includes new UI elements that indicate when attributes reference
           resources, and flag errors and warnings, such as invalid or hard-coded values.
